## ✅ What You Already Have

Your platform has **complete authentication** with these pages:

### **Auth Pages (Already Built):**
```
✅ /signin              - Login page
✅ /signup              - Registration page
✅ /verify              - Email verification
✅ /forgot-password     - Password reset request
✅ /reset-password      - Password reset form
```

### **API Endpoints (Auto-Generated by NextAuth):**
```
✅ /api/auth/signin     - Login API
✅ /api/auth/signout    - Logout API
✅ /api/auth/session    - Get current session
✅ /api/auth/csrf       - CSRF protection
✅ /api/auth/providers  - List auth providers
```
