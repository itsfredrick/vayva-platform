# Vayva Copy Truth Rules (Internal)

_Version: 1.0 (2025-12-26)_

These rules ensure that Vayva's public-facing copy is technically honest, legally defensible, and sets accurate expectations for merchants.

## 1. Banned Words & Replacements

| Banned Word/Phrase      | Why?                                                                     | Recommended Replacement                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Automatic"             | Implies no human effort. Most Vayva flows require setup or verification. | "Assisted", "Configurable", "Guided", "Smart"                          |
| "Guarantee(s)"          | Legally dangerous. We cannot guarantee sales or delivery.                | "Empower", "Help", "Optimize", "Streamline"                            |
| "Payment Processor"     | We are not a licensed payment processor.                                 | "Payment Integration", "Wallet Infrastructure"                         |
| "Banking"               | We are not a bank.                                                       | "Wallet", "Account Balance", "Funds Routing"                           |
| "AI-Powered" (Generic)  | Vague and overused.                                                      | Describe the specific AI action (e.g., "AI-assisted order extraction") |
| "Free Withdrawals"      | Untrue (5% fee applies).                                                 | "Wallet Settlement", "Direct Bank Payout"                              |
| "Compliance Guaranteed" | Compliance is a merchant responsibility.                                 | "Compliance-Ready", "Audit-Ready Logs"                                 |

## 2. Platform vs. Merchant Roles

- **Platform (Vayva):** Provides the software, database, and integration connectors.
- **Merchant (You):** Owns the business, verifies the orders, ships the goods, and handles customer service.

**Rule:** Never imply Vayva is a party to the merchant-customer transaction.

## 3. Integration Framing

Always frame 3rd party tools (WhatsApp, Paystack, Logistics) as **integrations**.

- **Incorrect:** "Vayva ships your goods."
- **Correct:** "Vayva integrates with your preferred logistics providers."

## 4. Automation Honesty

If a feature requires a merchant to click a button (e.g., "Approve Order"), it is not "Automatic". It is "Assisted".

## 5. Dispute Disclaimer

Always ensure it's clear that Vayva does not mediate disputes between merchants and customers.
"Disputes are handled directly between the Merchant and the End-Customer."
