# 2) Theme customization

## STABILITY MODE (APPLY — DO NOT DEVIATE)
* Page: `/admin/store/themes/customize` (Full screen builder, maybe custom shell or AdminShell collapsed?).
* Using standard `AdminShell` but potentially hiding sidebar for builder mode if needed, or just standard. Spec says "same theme + app shell".

## Layout (3-Column Builder)
* **Header**: Device Toggles, Live Preview badge, Save/Discard.
* **Left (Sections)**: Sortable list of home page sections.
* **Center (Preview)**: Iframe/Div embedded storefront.
* **Right (Settings)**: Tabs (Section vs Theme Settings).
