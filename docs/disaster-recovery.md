# Disaster Recovery Playbook

## Backup Strategy

### Postgres Backups
- **Frequency**: Daily full backup + continuous WAL archiving
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Storage**: S3 with encryption
- **Command**: `pg_dump -Fc vayva_prod > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).dump`

### Object Storage
- **Lifecycle**: 90-day retention for exports/media
- **Versioning**: Enabled for critical buckets

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Restore
1. Stop all services
2. Restore from backup: `pg_restore -d vayva_prod backup.dump`
3. Replay WAL if needed
4. Verify data integrity
5. Restart services

**RTO**: 4 hours
**RPO**: 1 hour (with WAL)

### Monthly Restore Drill
- Restore to staging environment
- Verify data completeness
- Test application functionality
- Document any issues

## Incident Playbooks

### Payments Provider Outage
1. Enable kill-switch: `payments_new_checkouts_disabled`
2. Show merchant banner: "Payments temporarily unavailable"
3. Queue all payment webhooks for later processing
4. Monitor provider status page
5. When restored: disable kill-switch, process queued webhooks

### WhatsApp Webhook Outage
1. Webhooks will queue automatically (outbox pattern)
2. Monitor DLQ for failures
3. Check provider status
4. When restored: replay DLQ if needed

### Delivery Partner Outage (Kwik)
1. Enable kill-switch: `carrier_kwik_disabled`
2. Show merchant banner: "Kwik temporarily unavailable, use self-dispatch"
3. Queue dispatch jobs
4. When restored: disable kill-switch, process queue

### Queue Backlog Runaway
1. Check worker health
2. Scale workers horizontally
3. Pause low-priority queues (analytics, exports)
4. Monitor queue depth
5. Resume when stable

### Data Corruption Suspected
1. Stop writes immediately
2. Restore from last known good backup
3. Investigate corruption source
4. Apply fixes
5. Resume operations
