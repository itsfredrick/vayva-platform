Project-only: Work strictly within the vayva-platform repo and its configured environments.

No scope creep: Do not invent features/pages/flows outside the Vayva roadmap unless explicitly requested.

Follow project memory: Pricing, plans, integrations, and UI template constraints are authoritative until changed by Fred.

Branch policy: Do not commit directly to main unless explicitly instructed.

Default workflow: feature/<topic> branch → PR → review notes in PR description → merge.

Commit style: Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, chore:, refactor:, test:, docs:.

PR hygiene: PR must include: summary, screenshots (UI), testing notes, risk notes, and rollback note.

No “silent changes”: Any behavioral change must be documented in PR notes.
