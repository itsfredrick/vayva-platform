# Authorization Rules

## Audience Separation
We strictly separate authentication contexts using the `aud` claim in JWTs.

| Audience | Description | Access Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `merchant` | Sellers & Staff | Tenant-scoped data (Store A cannot see Store B) |
| `customer` | Marketplace Users | My Orders, Profile, Public Listings |
| `ops` | Vayva Internal | Global visibility, Moderation, System Config |
| `ops-pre-mfa`| MFA Pending | Only access to `/mfa/verify` |

## Tenant Isolation (Merchants)
- **Header**: `x-store-id` is required for store-specific operations.
- **Validation**: Middleware checks if `user.memberships` includes `x-store-id`.
- **Failure**: Returns `403 Forbidden` if user is not a member of the requested store.

## Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Merchant Roles
- **OWNER**: Can delete store, manage billing, invite admins.
- **ADMIN**: Can manage products, orders, settings, staff.
- **STAFF**: Can manage orders, view products. (Cannot change settings).

### Ops Roles
- **OPS_ADMIN**: Superuser. Can ban stores, refund any transaction.
- **OPS_AGENT**: Can view transactions, moderate listings, approve AI actions.
