# Auth Page Image Option B: "The Digital HQ"

**Concept**: Shift focus from the _person_ to the _platform_.
**Goal**: Visualise Vayva as the premium tool that powers modern commerce.

## Visual Elements

1.  **Subject**: A high-fidelity "device shot" in a lifestyle setting.
2.  **Composition**:
    - A premium smartphone (iPhone Pro style) lying on a textured surface (e.g., marble, polished wood, or matte white).
    - **Screen Content**: The Vayva Dashboard showing "Total Sales: ₦1.2M" or a "New Order" notification.
    - **Props**: Subtle indicators of commerce—a branded shopping bag, a shipping label printer, or a sleek coffee cup.
3.  **Lighting**: Soft, diffused "studio" lighting. No harsh shadows.
4.  **Color Palette**:
    - Background: Cool Greys or White.
    - Accent: **Vayva Green** from the screen interfaces.

## Why this works?

- **Tangible Value**: It shows exactly _what_ the user gets—a beautiful app.
- **Aspirational**: It associates Vayva with a high-end, organized lifestyle.
- **Less Specific**: By removing the specific human subject, it appeals to _any_ type of merchant (introvert/extrovert, techie/creative).

## Recommendation

This option is best if you want to emphasize the **Software capabilities** and **UI Polish** over the human connection.
